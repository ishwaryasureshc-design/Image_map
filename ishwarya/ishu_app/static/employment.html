        The District Employment and Career Guidance Centre in Perambalur, 
        located at Perambalur South, opposite the District Central Library,
        serves as a crucial hub for job seekers and employers. As part of the
        Tamil Nadu government's initiative, the former District Employment 
        Offices were re-branded in 2019 to reflect a broader scope of activities 
        beyond simple registration. The main objective of the centre is to enhance 
        the employability of local youth through comprehensive career guidance and 
        counselling services. To achieve this, the office provides free coaching classes,
        study materials, and library facilities for individuals preparing for competitive
        examinations such as TNPSC, UPSC, and others. The centre's services have been 
        largely digitized, allowing candidates to register their educational 
        qualifications, renew their registrations, and update their profiles online
        via the official web portal, www.tnvelaivaaippu.gov.in. For those who prefer
        in-person service, e-service centres are available across the district</h3>
