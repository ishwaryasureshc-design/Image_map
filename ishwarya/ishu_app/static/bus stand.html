        the main bus terminal serving the town of Perambalur is the New Bus Stand,
        which is centrally located on New Bus Stand Road in the Sungu Pettai area. 
        As a crucial transportation hub for the district, the bus stand connects Perambalur
        to various parts of Tamil Nadu and neighboring states. It serves as a transit
        point for numerous routes operated by both the government-run Tamil Nadu State
        Transport Corporation (TNSTC) and several private bus operators. The terminal is
        a significant transit point for those traveling to major cities like Chennai,
        Trichy, Salem, and Bangalore. Local town buses also operate from the bus stand,
        linking Perambalur to its surrounding villages and towns. The bus stand,
        which is open 24 hours a day, handles a high volume of passenger traffic,
        especially during peak hours in the morning and evening. The New Bus Stand 
        features multiple bus bays to accommodate a large number of buses 
        simultaneously. While the terminal is spacious and provides access from 
        nearby highways, some reviewers have noted concerns about cleanliness and 
        congestion, particularly during rush hours.</h3>
